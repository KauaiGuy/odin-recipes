    <h2>Follow this recipe for a yummy chocolate chip cookie recipe!</h2>
    <p>These chocolate chip cookies are to die for! Make them for your friends and family!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong> This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong> Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking Soda:</strong> Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty</li>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</li>
        <li><strong>Chocolate Chips: </strong>Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat the butter and sugars, then beat in the eggs and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Add the baking soda to the mixture.</li>
        <li>Stir in the flour and chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Drop dough onto a prepared baking sheet.</li>
